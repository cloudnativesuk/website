Cloud Natives UK is back for July 2023 in-person and with an international
guest, none other than CNCF Ambassador Alessandro Vozza!

A community leader and CNCF ambassador, Alessandro has spent the last few years
building cloud native infrastructures for Microsoft customers, animating the
Dutch community, and training others to pass the CKx exams. He has passion for
all things cloud native, he's been around open source for 25 years and recently
moved to a new Developer Relations role at Solo.io, where he's on a mission to
install a service mesh in every Kubernetes cluster he gets his hands on.

If you want to get in touch, you can find him on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrovozza),
[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/bongo), and

Alessandro is joining us for two meetups, Manchester on the 18th of July and
then Edinburgh on the 19th, and links to the indivdual events are below.

The hits just keep on coming - hereâ€™s the second edition of Cloud Natives UK on **May 6th**. This is a joint virtual event being put together by the Cloud groups in Manchester, Wales, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and now we also welcome Cloud Native Bristol to the family! Together we represent nearly 5000 people from cloud native communities across the UK.

Weâ€™re really pleased to welcome our very special guest Justin Garrison, whoâ€™ll be joining us live from Los Angeles. Justin is a Developer Advocate at AWS where he helps improve container services for everyone. In the past he has helped make Oscar winning movies, built infrastructure for Disney+, and has been active in open source for a long time.

Justin is the author of [Cloud Native Infrastructure](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Justin-Garrison/dp/1491984309), a great contributor to the Cloud Native community, and a fantastic speaker. If you missed his talk at the last KubeCon NA, we highly recommend [checking it out](https://youtu.be/VtedIghTPzI).

Weâ€™ll update this event with Justinâ€™s talk nearer to the event. Once again weâ€™ll have a roundtable discussion around all things cloud native, with questions from our communities, and some lightning talks.

Weâ€™ve got some questions up our sleeves that weâ€™ll be asking, but weâ€™d also love to have your questions that youâ€™d like us to put to Justin, or to any of the panelists. Let us know on any of the usual channels and weâ€™ll send you some free swag !

The event will be live streamed to YouTube, and weâ€™ll add the link closer to the time.

Weâ€™ve got more of these linkups in the pipeline, keep your eyes peeled for the next event!

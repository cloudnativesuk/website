The inaugural Cloud Natives UK event with Dan "POP" Papandrea!  This one's scheduled for March 25th and will kick off at 6pm GMT.

<!--more-->

This is a joint virtual event being put together by the Cloud Native groups in [Manchester](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Kubernetes-Manchester/), [Wales](https://www.meetup.com/cloudnativewales/), [Glasgow](https://www.meetup.com/CloudNativeGlasgow/) and [Edinburgh](https://www.meetup.com/cloud-native-kubernetes-edinburgh/), representing the cloud native communities from each of the countries in mainland UK.

Weâ€™re really pleased to welcome our very special guest Dan "Pop" Papandrea, whoâ€™ll be joining us live from New York. Dan heads up open source advocacy at Sysdig, is a CNCF Ambassador, gives a ton of his time to the CNCF community and is the host of one of the best Cloud Native podcasts out there - [The PopCast](https://www.youtube.com/c/thepopcastpop).

Danâ€™s talk will be :

"Runtime Security is like making biscuits... you need the right ingredients

In this talk we will show runtime security capabilities with Falco and its uses by:

* an attack to a pod and or kubernetes service
* rule violation and how to create rules
* remediation (using Falcosidekick/Functions) to various outputs

You will come out of this with an appreciation of Falco... and perhaps more importantly BISCUITS!"

As if that wasnâ€™t enough, Dan will be joining us for a roundtable discussion with the organisers from each of our communities, where weâ€™ll be chatting about the challenges of running communities in the virtual world, biscuits, podcasts and all things cloud native. Weâ€™ve got some questions up our sleeves that weâ€™ll be asking, but weâ€™d also love to have your questions that youâ€™d like us to put to Dan, or to any of the panelists. Let us know on any of the usual channels and weâ€™ll send you some free swag !

And for even more Cloud Native goodness, weâ€™ll have lightning talks from all of you lovely folks ! Our lightning speakers will be:

* Salman Iqbal (Cloud Native Wales) - What happens when you create a pod in Kubernetes
* Sandro Cirulli (Cloud Native Manchester) - assessing EKS cluster security using kube-bench
* Dan Gora (Cloud Native Edinburgh) - Attacking and defending cloud-native services and workloads in Azure
* James MacDonald (Cloud Native Glasgow) - Multi-cloud, why itâ€™s a sensible strategy and how do you get there?

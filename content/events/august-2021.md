Many of us at Cloud Natives UK have been working hard over the last couple of months to put together the first [Kubernetes Community Days UK](https://kcduk.io), so much hard work in fact that weâ€™ve decided to have a launch party and invite some of our favourite speakers to get the ball rolling!

Our headline speaker needs no introduction: itâ€™s Liz Rice! But if we were going to give an introduction weâ€™d mention that Liz is the Chief Open Source Officer with eBPF pioneers Isovalent, the chair of the CNCFâ€™s Technical Oversight Committee, an ambassador for Open UK, and author of Container Security: Fundamental Technology Concepts that Protect Containerized Applications. At this point, you might be surprised to hear that Liz has free time (!?!) where she can be found riding her bike or banging the drums.

Our second speaker, Andrew Martin, has an incisive security engineering ethos gained building and destroying high-traffic web applications. Proficient in systems development, testing, and operations, he is comfortable profiling and securing every tier of a bare metal or cloud native system, and has battle-hardened experience delivering containerised solutions to enterprise and government. He is a co-founder at https://control-plane.io Andrew has presented at international conferences including KubeCon, Velocity, SANS, OWASP, DevOpsDays, Container Camp, IPExpo, and numerous other local events and meetups.
Weâ€™ll also be announcing some of the speakers and workshops for Kubernetes Community Days UK and sharing more information about what you can expect.

The event will be live streamed to YouTube - RSVP via one of the meetup links below:
